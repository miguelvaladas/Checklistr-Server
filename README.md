<h1>Checklistr</h1>

I am currently building Checklistr (MVP phase), a "checklist" app that allows users to keep track of whatever they want!

<h3>Motivation:</h3> Right after my bootcamp was over I decided I wanted to further enhance my skills and learn <b>React</b> and <b>Spring Boot</b>. And I did! However I have always been curious about how authentication and authorization systems work, so it seemed like a great opportunity to also learn <b>Spring Security</b> and <b>JWT</b>. It took me a little over 2 weeks to learn those skills on my own and get the app from zero to the MVP phase.

<h3>Tech Stack</h3>
Frontend: <b>React</b>, <b>Vite</b> and <b>Bootstrap</b>.</br>
Backend: <b>Spring Boot</b>, <b>Spring Security</b>, <b>JWT</b>, <b>Hibernate</b> and <b>MySQL</b>.

<h3>Final Considerations</h3>
I am currently looking for my first opportunity as a software developer and I'm passionate about both frontend and backend.
